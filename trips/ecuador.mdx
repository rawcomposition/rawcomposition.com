After arriving in Quito we went to the Papallacta for a day. My wife and the others on the trip enjoyed the hot springs while I went birding. Numbers weren't great but it was certainly worthwhile. Here's a few of the highlights.

The rest of the time I spent casually birding around Mindo. One particular place, San Tadeo, really stood out. They have hummingbird and fruit feeders. Here's a few of my favorites.

In addition, I paid for the half-day birding tour at the famous Refugio Paz de las Aves (Angel Paz). The owner hand feeds the antpittas and the refuge also provides great looks at many other species. I had 70 species in one morning. Here's a few highlights.
