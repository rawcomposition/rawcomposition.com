My wife and I had planned to rent a camping van and stay at various places around the country. We tried it for a couple days and quickly realized we wanted a real shower and toilet, so we ditched the camping and stayed at a nice AirBnB! As a result, I didn't see nearly as many birding places as I wanted, but I did manage to spend a day birding Monteverde at the [Curi-Cancha Reserve](https://ebird.org/checklist/S127884204). This was by far the best birding of the trip. I ran into a couple from Turkey and Switzerland who were also birding, and we had a great time together.

The rest of the trip was spent in the Nicoya Peninsula, primarily in Playa Carrillo. Here's some of my favorite shots from there.
