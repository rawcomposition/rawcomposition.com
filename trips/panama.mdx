This was another vacation trip where I managed to fit in some birding. I wasn't exactly staying in prime areas for birding, so overall it wasn't my best birding trip, but I did pick up 35 lifers which was alright. My time was mostly split between Panama City area and the little island of Bocas Del Toro. I made it to the famous Pipeline Road spot about 40 mins out of Panama City on my first day. I wanted to go back but I ended up getting into a car accident (not my fault) which disrupted my plans a little! Regardless, here's a selection of some of my less bad shots.

The gardens surounding the Biomuseum were surprisingly good for hummingbirds that I didn't see anywhere else.
