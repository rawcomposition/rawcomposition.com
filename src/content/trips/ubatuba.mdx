I spent about a week in Ubatuba, Brazil with my wife, birding and relaxing. We didn't really venture beyond about 45 mins either direction along the coast, though we did make a brief stop at a marsh on the drive from the airport down to the coast. Here's a selection of some of my favorite shots from the trip.
